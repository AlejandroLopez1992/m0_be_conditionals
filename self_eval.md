# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators? I feel confident in my understanding
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators? I feel confident in my understanding
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements? I feel confident in my understanding
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate? I definitely spent more time than I had assigned for this lesson. I decided I wanted to tackle all of the code_challenged to give myself the best understanding as I go forward and although it was productive struggle it ate a lot more time up.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? I feel like I got sufficient practice to move forward and tackle the rest of the lessons.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? I don't have questions at the moment but know my resources to ask them if they come up
